Telerik is 3rd party UI and required to take subscription.
But here we are using 30 days monthly subscription in order to practice it.

Loggin is an important aspect in development which is used to generate logs in development.
This are very helpful in production phase due to its informative nature.

For practice we have implemented simple Book management system.
This project may not run if you dont have subscription and even if you have, imports are for free-use 30 days subscription hence need to change them as well.
To know what is used in telerik :
1. DateTimePicker
2. DropDownList
3. Grid
4. Notification
5. PieChart

Putting the video of project along.
